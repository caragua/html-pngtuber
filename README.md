# html-pngtuber
Yet another basic pngtuber

Damn basic and (per my understanding) easy-to-use pngtuber program.

## To use, just:
1. Open the page
2. "Start Microphone" (allow access to your microphone)
3. Load Idle/Speaking PNG files
4. Talk.

## Available adjustments inclide:
1. Audio volume multiplier
   > If your input volume is too low, increase this to make volume changes easier to identify.
3. Volume threshold
   > When to kick-in the "speaking" state.
5. Idle delay
   > How long should it wait before going back to "idle" state when volume is lower then the threshold.
6. Background color
   > Green screen, chroma key, ... etc. The color that should be filtered out and become transparent.
8. Avatar sets
   > Quickly switch up to 5 avatar sets.

## Tested with:
- OS: Windows 10
- Browser: Firefox Developer Edition
  * Normal browsers would do, but will stop updating the page if the window isn't visible. (aka, updates paused when not in foreground).
  * Easiest way to make it still work is just install Firefox Developer Edition and run it. Works unless minimized manually.
- Streaming Software: OBS
