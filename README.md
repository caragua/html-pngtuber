Yet another basic pngtuber

Damn basic and (per my understanding) easy-to-use pngtuber program.

## To use, just:
1. Open the page
2. "Start Microphone" (allow access to your microphone)
3. Load Idle/Speaking PNG files
4. Talk.

## Available adjustments inclide:
1. Audio volume multiplier
   If your input volume is too low, increase this to make volume changes easier to identify.
3. Volume threshold
   When to kick-in the "speaking" state.
5. Idle delay
   How long should it wait before going back to "idle" state when volume is lower then the threshold.
6. Background color
   Green screen, chroma key, ... etc. The color that should be filtered out and become transparent.
8. Avatar sets
   Quickly switch up to 5 avatar sets.
